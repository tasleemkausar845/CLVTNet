## ðŸ“– Overview  
This repository contains the official implementation of **CLVTNet**, an efficient **CNN-based Spatial Channel Enhanced Vision Transformer** for **Auditory Attention Detection (AAD)** using EEG signals.  

Our model integrates **CNN feature extraction** with a **Vision Transformer backbone** enhanced by a **spatial channel attention module**, enabling robust and efficient auditory attention decoding.
